# 🌐 Modern Data Pipeline GCP

A production-grade, modular ETL pipeline built with **Apache Airflow**, integrated with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** services and **DBT** for transformation and modeling. This project demonstrates best practices in orchestration, cloud-native development, CI/CD, data quality, and monitoring — all in a real-world data pipeline context.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end ETL workflow designed for scalability, maintainability, and cloud readiness. It showcases how to orchestrate data pipelines using Airflow, enrich and transform data with DBT, and deploy the solution using containerized environments and CI/CD pipelines.

### 🔄 Pipeline Highlights:
- [X] Extracts data from a **PostgreSQL** source
- [ ] Enriches it with **exchange rate data** from an external API
- [ ] Loads the results to **CSV files** and **Google Sheets**
- [ ] Optionally pushes transformed data to **BigQuery**
- [ ] Includes **data quality checks** and **logging**
- [ ] Modular structure: `extract`, `transform`, `load`, `validate`, `notify`
- [ ] Uses **Docker + Docker Compose** for local orchestration
- [ ] Ready for deployment on **GCP Cloud Composer** or similar environments

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🌀 **Airflow** – DAG orchestration & scheduling

    > Apache Airflow is used to define, schedule, and monitor workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Each task (e.g., extract, transform, load) runs in sequence or parallel depending on dependencies. In your pipeline, it can automate running Python scripts for ingestion, transformation, and loading at specific intervals (e.g., daily at 1am).

- 🧱 **DBT** – SQL transformations inside BigQuery
    
    > DBT (Data Build Tool) enables modular, version-controlled data transformations using SQL. It runs inside your warehouse (e.g., BigQuery), letting you build models with dependencies, test logic, and document results. Ideal for transforming raw data into analytics-ready datasets in BigQuery.

- ☁️ **GCP** – BigQuery 📈, Sheets API 📄, Secret Manager 🔐

    > BigQuery: Serverless data warehouse for fast querying and analytics.

    > Google Sheets API: Used to export or update transformed data directly into shared spreadsheets for reporting or stakeholder access.

    > Secret Manager: Securely stores credentials and API keys (e.g., DB passwords, service account tokens) for safe access from scripts or containers.

- 🐳 **Docker** – Containerized development environments

    > Docker ensures consistent, reproducible environments for running your pipeline—locally or in the cloud. It packages dependencies, Python versions, and configuration into a container image, avoiding "works on my machine" issues.

- 🐍 **Python** – Core logic, APIs, transformations
    
    > Python powers the core business logic of the pipeline—API ingestion, data transformation (Pandas or PySpark), error handling, logging, and exporting results. It's also used for integrating with GCP, PostgreSQL, and 3rd-party APIs.

- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** – Source database

    > PostgreSQL is the primary data source for the pipeline. Python scripts connect via SQLAlchemy or psycopg2 to extract records, which are then cleaned and loaded into BigQuery or other destinations.

- 🤖 **CI/CD** – GitHub Actions automation

## 🚀 Getting Started

#### ✅ Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.9+
- `make` (optional, for using the Makefile)

---

#### ⚙️ Local Setup

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CamilaJaviera91/modern-data-pipeline-gcp.git
cd modern-data-pipeline-gcp

# Create `.env` file with required variables
cp .env.example .env
```

#### 🧭 Step-by-step guide to create a virtual environment in VS Code

1. Open the command palette
Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette.

2. Select the Python interpreter
Type and select **"Python: Select Interpreter"**.

3. Create a virtual environment

    - Click on "+ Create Virtual Environment..."

    - Choose the environment type: select "Venv"

    - Select the Python version you want to use (e.g., Python 3.10.17)

4. Wait for the virtual environment to be created
VS Code will automatically create a `.venv` folder in your project and configure the environment.

5. Activate the virtual environment
Once it's created, we can activate it.

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

## ✅ Testing

- **DBT tests** for schema, uniqueness, and relationships
- **Airflow DAG validation**: `airflow dags list`, `airflow dags test`
- **Unit tests** for custom Python functions in `/scripts` or `/dags`
- **CI pipeline** (planned): Linting, formatting, DAG validation, DBT compile

---

## 📡 Monitoring & Logging

- Airflow task logs viewable via the web UI
- Custom loggers for API responses and ETL steps
- Optionally integrates with **Stackdriver Logging** and **Alerting**

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Add unit tests for transformation logic
- [ ] Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Auto-deploy to Cloud Composer
- [ ] Add support for other destinations (e.g., Snowflake, S3)
