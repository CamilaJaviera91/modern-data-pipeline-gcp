# 🌐 Modern Data Pipeline GCP

A production-grade, modular ETL pipeline built with **Apache Airflow**, integrated with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** services and **DBT** for transformation and modeling. This project demonstrates best practices in orchestration, cloud-native development, CI/CD, data quality, and monitoring — all in a real-world data pipeline context.
